# Critique
  * Landing page, the "Infinite Memories" should be one line. DONE
  * Remove bottom margin from .question-container DONE
  * Figure out the whitespace on the quiz elements DONE
  * Weird zooming issue with Calendar elements

## Results

 * .stay {
   display: flex;
   //Center it vertically with the text aligned to the left of the card
 }
 * The tag list should be aligned on the left with the rest of the screen
 * Align the tab nav with the cards on the left
 * Deal with the weird border issue around cards
 * Dialog
